# Svelte-Tailwind-Rollup-Starter
A barebones starter project for Svelte with Tailwind CSS and Rollup



## Install Dependencies
npm install

## Dev
npm run dev

## Build
npm run build


### Notes
The first time this project runs, the bundler will take some time to run the dev server. Everything should work as expected after that.
No scripts (package.json) are changed.

Tailwind was integrated with the help of this article:https://dev.to/ardc_overflow/setting-up-svelte-and-tailwind-with-minimal-extra-dependencies-1g5a
